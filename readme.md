## üóí Notes

- The application is not polished (as requested) :)
- The code contains only integration tests.
- I've commited the entire .env to git for ease of use.
- The app currently only contains a docker configuration for a development environment. For production, a different configuration would be used.
- The spec requires a deckId field name. I have used "\_id" instead. (Default MongoDB naming convention.)
